# YARF (Yet Another Recon Framework)

**YARF** is a Bash script that automates recon for web app pentests. It integrates various tools to streamline tasks like root domain and subdomain enum, bruteforcing, endpoint discovery, service scanning, tech stack fingerprinting, and vuln scanning, organizing the output in a clean directory structure.

## Features

- **Automated Directory Setup**: Creates a structured directory for storing recon data.
- **Root domain enum**: Leverages Whois and ASN data via `Amass`.
- **Subdomain enum**: Leverages tools like `Amass` and `Subfinder`.
- **Spidering**: Crawls targets with `Gospider`, `Hakrawler`, and `Katana`.
- **Dirbusting**: Uses `Feroxbuster` with customizable wordlists.
- **Shodan Querying**: Queries Shodan without an API key using `smap-scanner`.
- **Service Scanning**: Performs comprehensive scan with `nmap`.
- **Tech Stack Fingerprinting**: Utilizes `WAFW00F`, `Webanalyze`, and `WhatWeb`.
- **Vuln Scanning**: Scans for vulns with `Nikto` and `Nuclei`.

## Requirements

Ensure the following tools are installed and available in your `$PATH`:

- `amass`
- `subfinder`
- `gospider`
- `hakrawler`
- `katana`
- `feroxbuster`
- `smap-scanner`
- `nmap`
- `nikto`
- `nuclei`
- `wafw00f`
- `webanalyze`
- `whatweb`

### Wordlist

By default, YARF uses the following wordlist for `Feroxbuster`:
`/usr/share/seclists/Discovery/Web-Content/common.txt`. You can specify a custom wordlist using the `-wordlist` flag.

## Usage

Run the script with the following arguments:

```bash
./yarf.sh -org <organization_name> -d <domain> [-ip <ip_range>] [-wordlist <path>]
```

## Arguments

- `-org`: **(Required)** Organization name for reconnaissance.
- `-d`: **(Required)** Target domain for reconnaissance.
- `-ip`: **(Optional)** IP range for scanning.
- `-wordlist`: **(Optional)** Custom wordlist for `Feroxbuster`.

## Example

```bash
./yarf.sh -org ExampleCorp -d example.com -ip 192.168.1.0/24 -wordlist /path/to/custom-wordlist.txt
```

## Output

All results are stored under a directory named `YARF/<organization_name>_pentest` in the user’s home directory. The structure includes:

- `00_domain_and_subdomain_enumeration`: Results of subdomain enumeration.
- `01_spidering_and_brute_forcing_endpoints`: Crawling and brute-forcing results.
- `02_server_side_scans`: Results of server-side scans.
- `03_tech_stack_fingerprinting_and_vuln_scans`: Tech stack fingerprinting and vulnerability scanning results.
- `04_vuln_validation_and_exploitation`: Reserved for manual validation and exploitation.
